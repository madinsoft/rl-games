The purpose of this project is to test and compare different ML tools to find the good strategy for a game from their specific rules.

There are several parts in this project:
- envs: game environments based on open gym plateform. 
- models: ML tools (NN, decision trees)
- policies: algorithms to find the best strategy
- players: player which composes all the three parts to play and learn games.
